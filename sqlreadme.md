**IMDB Movie and TV Shows Database Analysis**

**Overview**

Welcome to the IMDB Movie and TV Shows Database Analysis project! This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a sample IMDB database, including movie and TV show information, ratings, and other essential data. The analysis was performed using MySQL Workbench, and it encompasses various aspects such as brainstorming, system setup, business rules, entity-relationship diagram (ERD) creation, data loading, SQL-based queries, data visualization, and findings presentation.
Project Description

The primary goal of this project was to analyze the IMDB Movie and TV Shows Database to gain valuable insights and summarize business operations. The project's workflow can be summarized as follows:

    Brainstorming and Project Parameters: In this initial phase, the project parameters were defined, and the scope of the analysis was determined. Key objectives and questions to be answered were identified.

    System Setup and Sub-systems: The general system setup was outlined, and various sub-systems relevant to the analysis were identified. This helped in organizing and structuring the analysis process.

    Sub-system Business Rules: Detailed business rules for each sub-system were documented. These rules provided a clear understanding of the data and its relationships.

    ER Diagram Creation: A fully normalized Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to represent the database's schema and relationships between entities. The ERD served as the foundation for designing the database.

    Database Creation and Data Loading: Using MySQL queries, the database and tables were created to reflect the ERD's structure. Sample data from the IMDB database was loaded into the tables to enable analysis.

    SQL-Based Queries and Reporting: SQL queries were utilized to prepare a comprehensive report that summarized and synthesized the business operations within the database. These queries provided valuable insights into the dataset.

    Data Visualization: The insights gained from the SQL-based queries were visualized using appropriate data visualization tools. This step helped in presenting complex findings in a more understandable and engaging manner.

    Findings Presentation: The final step involved presenting the analysis findings to stakeholders. Visualizations and key insights were shared to provide a clear picture of the dataset's characteristics and trends.

**Project Structure**

The project is structured into the following sections:

    Documentation: This directory contains all the project-related documentation, including this README file.

    MySQL_Workbench: This directory holds the MySQL Workbench files used to create the ER diagram and execute SQL queries.

    Data: The "Data" directory contains the sample IMDB Movie and TV Shows Database used for analysis.

    Visualizations: In this directory, you can find the visualizations created from the analysis.

    Presentations: The "Presentations" directory includes any slides or materials used for presenting the findings to stakeholders.

**Getting Started**
